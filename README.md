# One Crypto Pass

## Introduction

This is currently a research project where Digital Identities and Verifiable Credentials are used to allow the decoding of secrets by anyone who was granted this right, pending on some external conditions.

## progress
    
    M1 delivered, see here https://milestones.projectcatalyst.io/projects/1200085/milestones/1
    
    M2: remaining for M2
    - Identus
        * how to notify instantly recipients of incoming VC offer / Presentation requests? (likely a DidComm extra param?)
        * how to pass non VC data into DidComm, such as Alice sending a passphrase to Bob?
    - provide an extra Identity layer (cloud backend) to simplify integration of Identus into the solution
    - finalise design of entire solution 
    - provide PoC with DID and VC and Notary inside the solution
